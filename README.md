# Customer Booking Analysis

## Introduction

This notebook explores customer booking data to uncover insights and build predictive models. The analysis focuses on understanding booking behavior and identifying factors that influence booking completion. 

### Motive of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to:
1. Analyze customer booking patterns and trends.
2. Identify key factors that influence whether a booking is completed.
3. Build predictive models to classify and forecast booking completion status, enabling better decision-making for customer engagement strategies.

### Target Variable
- **`booking_complete`:**  
  - **Type:** Binary (0 or 1)  
  - **Description:** Indicates whether a booking was completed (`1`) or not (`0`).  
  - This variable serves as the primary outcome to predict.

### Key Areas of Analysis

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding the data structure and distribution.
   - Visualizing booking completion trends and other key metrics.
   - Identifying patterns and correlations among features.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning the raw dataset and handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features for model compatibility.
   - Feature engineering to improve model performance.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Implementing machine learning models to predict booking completion.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
   - Tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
